#### Karma Core Fields

KARMA Core fields can only be updated by the KARTA. Others can see, but can’t alter this information.

Some of the fields show green borders , which are locked and cannot be altered once information is fed into them.

There are some fields marked with asterisks. These are called Key Fields, means KARTA should ensure that these fields are filled up before Karma can be created.

#### Recall | Return | Reopen | Repeat

Based on the Context, at the Bottom of the Karma you can see one of the following combinations:

Repeat | Recall 	\[Karma Assigned by You\]

Repeat | Return 	\[Karma Assigned to you by others\]

Repeat | Reopen 	\[Karma Closed, i.e. Done or Dump\]

Repeat                   	\[Karma self-assigned\]

KARTA can Return the KARMA back to the Assignor.

Assigner can Recall the KARMA back from the KARTA.

All the 3 Actions requires reason to be mentioned. They are taken as exceptions and reflects on top of the KARMA in Red.

Any Karma from any stage can be set to Repeat at defined frequency. It is explained in Depth in Advanced Karma Assignment.

Karta / Doer & CoActor

Below that you see the Karta & Co-Actors.

Karta may choose to assign the Karma to some other Karta.

Karta and Assignor can chose to invite Co-Actors for the Karma.

Karma Tags

Each Karma can be Tagged by using a #. For example, Karma related to a project or a campaign can be tagged to help a combined tracking.

Quick Navigation Bar

Once you move inside expense, material, time, updates or files, you also see a top bar as below offering quick navigation between Karma Story. From Left to Right the icons stands for – Story Home, Expenses, Material, Time Log, Updates and attachments.

Expenses

Simply select the Expense Head, Fill in the Amount, Write any notes you want, attach the receipts \[photo, screen shot etc.\] and Add.

It gets added to the expense log of this KARMA with the name of the person.

All stake holders can record the expenses incurred in context of this KARMA.

A user can delete his Expense for up to 1 Day and there after deletion is not allowed.

Material

Simply select the Item, Quantity & Rate and Add. With each item it is possible to record additional notes and also an image. This can be detailed specification or anything important.

Item can be selected from the list or it can be typed as a New Item \[That is categorised as Unclassified\].

Once all items are entered, you can update and that becomes the complete bill of material.

Once a List is updated at the bottom we see “Revise” and “Show Revisions”.

With Revise, any stake holder of this KARMA can revise the Bill of Material.

Once you chose to revise you can:

\-	Change/Delete the Qty / Rates of already existing line items.

\-	Add more items to the list.

All the revisions logs the user name & date time stamp with the revision.

Show revision cleanly shows how the story unfolded.

Time Log & Scheduling

Time log helps in tracking utilisation of time by individuals involved in a karma. Karma Axis converts this time to a monetary value (Based on Rate/Hr defined for all users) to represent contribution by the individuals.

User can login his time devoted under Any Karma.

<Start Time> <End Time> and Utilisation%

Utilisation% act as the weightage multiplier.  So if you have worked for say from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM but effectively utilised only half the time, you can put 50% Utilisation for the time on this KARMA. So the actual time invested will be considered as 2 Hours and not 4 Hours.

You can also put in the Notes along with the time slot.
