### Creating a New Karma

\+KARMA menu lists the Karma groups neatly. Click on the KARMA you wish to create and it opens the Karma Form for creation. Just fill up the form and select the KARTA/DOER in order to assign responsibility. On creation, a KARMA No is assigned and it shows up in the KARMA HUB of all concerned (Creator, Karta, Co-Actor).

The Karma Story evolves as work progresses and actions are recorded.
