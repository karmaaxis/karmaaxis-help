KarmaAxis management philosophy defines every activity as a Karma. Thus, Opportunity, Order, Service Ticket, Designing, Project, Collection, Filing Tax Returns, Maintenance, Production Log, Research, Trials, Claims and any other activity can be structured as a Karma.

Each organization designs its own set of Karmas and as per requirements, they can re-jig, re-discover, calibrate, alter or add Karmas. Thereby, giving utmost flexibility and dynamism to management functions. 

The Karmas may be grouped as per functional preferences based on organizational priorities and philosophy. Every Karma is listed under the group it is structured. 

KARMA marked as a Favourite is listed outside the group on Top for quick access. 

On the left side of a KARMA, sits a star icon â€“ just click it to mark the KARMA as a Favourite. Clicking it again moves it out of the favourite list.
