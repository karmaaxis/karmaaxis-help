## Karma, Groups & Favourites

<hr>

KarmaAxis management philosophy defines every activity as a Karma. Thus, Opportunity, Order, Service Ticket, Designing, Project, Collection, Filing Tax Returns, Maintenance, Production Log, Research, Trials, Claims and any other activity can be structured as Karma.

Each organization designs its own set of Karmas and as per requirements re-jig, re-discover, calibrate, alter or add Karmas. Thus giving utmost flexibility and dynamism to management function.

The Karmas may be grouped as per functional preferences based on organizational priorities and philosophy. Every Karma is listed under the group it is structured.

Favourite marked KARMA are listed outside the group on Top for quick access.

On the left of KARMA there is a star – just click it to make the Karma Favourite. Click it again and it moves out of favourite list.
