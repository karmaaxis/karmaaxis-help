## Karma, Groups & Favourites

Karma Axis management philosophy defines every activity as a Karma. Thus, Opportunity, Order, Service Ticket, Designing, Project, Collection, Filing Tax Returns, Maintenance, Production Log, Research, Trials, Claims and any other activities can be structured as Karma.

Each organization designs its own set of Karmas and as per requirement re-jig, re-discover, calibrate, alter or add Karmas. Thus giving utmost flexibility and dynamism to management function.

The Karmas may be grouped as per functional preferences based on organizational priorities and philosophy. Every Karma is listed under the group it is structured.

Favourite marked KARMA are listed outside the group on Top for quick access.

On the left of KARMA there is a star – just click it to make the Karma Favourite. Click it again and it moves out of favourite list.

## Karma Actors, Roles & Rights

### Creator:

It is the user who can initiate a New Karma and assign to someone. For every KARMA list of eligible Creators is defined and only they can create that KARMA.

### Karta \[Doer\]:

For every KARMA there is a primary KARTA or Doer who is responsible for that KARMA. For every KARMA type, the list of eligible KARTA is defined. Only users from this list can be made KARTA for the particular KARMA type.

### 

### Co Actors:

For every KARMA there can be CoActors who shall be supporting or engaging with those KARTA for the particular KARMA. No rights are required to invite anyone as a CoActor.

### 

### Coordinator:

This is a special right given to certain individuals. The Rights are specific to a Particular Karma type. So someone may be a coordinator for say ‘LEADS’ karma. In such case the ‘LEADS’ Karma Coordinator \[Local\] can see all the ‘LEADS’ Karmas for users reporting to his/her boss. A ‘LEADS’ Coordinator \[Global\] can see LEADS of all the users in the organization.

### Pool Members:

KARMAs can be marked for assigning to POOLs. This can be done by the Administrator. All potential KARTA of such a KARMA are the POOL members. When these KARMAs are assigned to POOLs, they show up in the POOL of all respective POOL members (users). Once someone picks up the KARMA it automatically moves out of the Pool.

### Reports to:

Each user reports to a senior. The default rights are laid out such that everyone can see reports of all the users reporting to them. This is defined by the Administrator while setting up users.
